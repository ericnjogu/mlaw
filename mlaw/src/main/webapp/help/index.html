	<p>The <span class="label">Location</span> and <span class="label">Comment</span> fields can accept exact values e.g. 
	<span class="sample_input">milimani</span> or <span class="sample_input">meeting</span>.<br/>
	Wildcards can also be used for these fields to match data containing the specified value. e.g. <br/>
	<span class="sample_input">*court*</span> - match any data containing the word <span class="sample_input">court</span>. <br/>
	<span class="sample_input">*meeting*</span> - match any data containing the word <span class="sample_input">meeting<span class="sample_input">.
	</p>
