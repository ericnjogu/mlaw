# mlaw

mLaw is physical file records automation web application based on the kuali rice framework.

It was originally created to help with managing legal records. A physical file is represented by a 'matter'. Any number of required documents can be defined for a matter. A matter can be also assigned to a user while indicating whether they have physical possession.

mLaw is multi-user, and role based. It is also workflow enabled, allowing it to adapt to existing organizational processes and multi-level approvals.

It offers email notifications. It can be integrated with LDAP for login and works with OpenID out of the box.

Each action taken is represented by an electronic document that allows auditing of changes matters as well as tracking the specific times it took for individuals to carry out specific actions.

Soft copy documents are easily attached and made accessible within each individual matter - with this process subject to the default or customized workflow for approval.
